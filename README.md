## Enhancing Vision Models for Text-Heavy Content Understanding and Interaction

### Problem Statement:

The challenge lies in optimizing vision models for comprehensive understanding of text-rich content, such as textbooks, research papers, and documents. Current vision models lack effective integration with textual information, hindering their ability to interpret and interact with images containing substantial text. The goal is to bridge this gap and enhance the model's capability to extract meaningful information from images heavily laden with text.

### Approach:

Our approach involves a multi-stage methodology to iteratively refine the vision model's understanding of text-intensive images. Starting with a base language model and integrating an image embedding model, we employ an adapter mechanism to align the language model for improved comprehension of image data. Fine-tuning is then performed using instructional-oriented image data, specifically focusing on text recognition and enabling image-text interaction. Evaluations are conducted using both existing benchmarks and custom metrics to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of the model.

### Stages:

1. **Dataset Preprocessing:**
    - Convert PDF documents into image format.
    - Utilize GPT-4 Vision API to extract information from images.
    - Prepare the dataset to train the vision model on text-heavy content.
    
    Procedure
    
    - **Step 1: ArXiv Paper Source Files**. In this step, you need to obtain the source files of scientific papers from arXiv, which is a repository of preprints in various fields of science and mathematics. You can use the arXiv API to download the source files in LaTeX format.
    - **Step 2: Paper Filtering**. In this step, you need to filter out the papers that are not relevant or suitable for your project. You can use some criteria such as the paper title, abstract, keywords, or categories to select the papers that contain text-heavy content, such as figures, tables, equations, or diagrams.
    - **Step 3: Figure-Caption Pair Extraction**. In this step, you need to extract the figure-caption pairs from the selected papers. You can use some tools or libraries such as pdfminer, pdftotext, or PyPDF2 to parse the PDF files and locate the figures and their captions. You can also use some heuristics or regular expressions to identify the figure labels and references in the LaTeX files.
    - **Step 4: Rule-based Cleaning**. In this step, you need to clean or refine the extracted figure-caption pairs using some rules or filters. You can remove the pairs that are incomplete, duplicated, or corrupted. You can also normalize the captions by removing the figure labels, references, or citations. You can also check the quality and resolution of the figures and ensure they are clear and legible.
    - **Step 5: GPT-4 Vision Prompting**. In this step, you need to use the cleaned figure-caption pairs as prompts for GPT-4 Vision, which is a large vision language model that can generate natural language based on visual inputs. You can use the format shown in the image to create answerable multiple-choice questions based on the figures. You can also provide the correct answer choice and the rationale for the correct answer.

2. **Fine-Tuning:**
    - Implement Lora fine-tuning to enhance the model’s performance. [Lora is a technique that reduces the number of parameters to update during fine-tuning by approximating the original weight matrix with two smaller matrices1](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[2](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/lora-for-fine-tuning-llms-explained-with-codes-and-example-62a7ac5a3578). [This can speed up the training process and avoid catastrophic forgetting, which is the loss of knowledge from the pre-trained model1](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[2](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/lora-for-fine-tuning-llms-explained-with-codes-and-example-62a7ac5a3578).
    - Train the model on instructional-oriented image data to improve text recognition and image-text interaction. [Instructional-oriented image data are images that contain text instructions or captions that describe the visual content or guide the user to perform certain tasks](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[3](https://github.com/yaodongC/awesome-instruction-dataset). For example, images of recipes, product manuals, or scientific figures. [Training the model on such data can help it learn to generate, understand, and follow text instructions based on visual inputs](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[3](https://github.com/yaodongC/awesome-instruction-dataset).
3. **Evaluation:**
    - Assess the model’s performance using existing benchmarks for image and text tasks. Existing benchmarks are datasets and metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the quality and accuracy of text-to-image models. [For example, HRS-Bench is a holistic, reliable, and scalable benchmark that measures 13 skills of text-to-image models across 50 scenarios](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05390). [COCO-Text is a dataset and benchmark for text detection and recognition in natural images](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[5](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/coco-text-dataset-and-benchmark-for-text).
    - Develop a custom benchmark to evaluate the model’s proficiency in understanding and interacting with text-heavy images. [Text-heavy images are images that contain a large amount of text or complex text structures, such as tables, charts, graphs, or diagrams](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[6](https://blog.segmind.com/beginners-guide-lora-fine-tuning/). A custom benchmark can be designed to test the model’s ability to generate, interpret, and answer questions based on text-heavy images. [For example, using the format of GPT-4 Vision Prompting](https://www.databricks.com/blog/efficient-fine-tuning-lora-guide-llms)[6](https://blog.segmind.com/beginners-guide-lora-fine-tuning/), which provides multiple-choice questions and answers based on scientific figures.

### Scope:

The project's scope encompasses advancing the capabilities of vision models to effectively interpret and engage with images containing extensive textual content. By focusing on text-heavy materials like textbooks, research papers, and documents, the project aims to provide a more versatile and knowledgeable vision model that can extract, understand, and interact with valuable information embedded in such visual-textual data.

This project lays the groundwork for enhancing the utility of vision models across various applications, including educational content analysis, document understanding, and image-text communication. The outcomes are expected to contribute to the broader field of multimodal AI, fostering advancements in models' ability to handle complex information amalgamations.
