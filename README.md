# üëÅÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è VARAG (Vision Augmented Retrieval and Generation)

| ![VARAG](./docs/assets/llama.png)| VARAG (Vision-Augmented Retrieval and Generation) is a vision-first RAG engine that emphasizes vision-based retrieval techniques. It enhances traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by integrating both visual and textual data through Vision-Language models. |
